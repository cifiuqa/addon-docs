You can find the documentation pages on the left.</p> <code>Documentation</code> This contains the information about the SCP:RP API functions, which you normally wouldn't find within other Roblox environments. <code>Roblox Integration</code> This contains information about how you can interact with normal Roblox functions with SCP:RP addons, which you cannot find in the default documentation. <code>Examples</code> This contains various code snippets and examples which can help you understand how to use different functions in the addons environment. You can find many more in the discord server! <p>AI Usage</p> <p>It is heavily recommended that you do not use AI to script for you. AI steals real programmers' works for its generation and often has overall poor practices. Additionally, you may encounter errors as AI are poor at coding in such environments.
