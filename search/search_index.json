This documentation site was made to improve the experience of scripters within SCP:RP, allowing for a better understanding of the API. Please note however, this is a passion project and we can't guarantee it will always be up-to-date.</p> <p>If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us from the discord server! You can find the documentation pages on the left.</p> <code>Documentation</code> This contains the information about the SCP:RP API functions, which you normally wouldn't find within other Roblox environments. <code>Roblox Integration</code> This contains information about how you can interact with normal Roblox functions with SCP:RP addons, which you cannot find in the default documentation. <code>Examples</code> This contains various code snippets and examples which can help you understand how to use different functions in the addons environment. You can find many more in the discord server! <p>AI Usage</p> <p>It is heavily recommended that you do not use AI to script for you. AI steals real programmers' works for its generation and often has overall poor practices. Additionally, you may encounter errors as AI are poor at coding in such environments. It is much better practice to look for real programmer's works or do it yourself, support some coders!</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"Mind can create, but machine can only imitate\"</p>"},{"location":"docs/","title":"Main Documentation","text":"<p>Server Addons are a great environment within SCP:RP custom servers for lots of customisable server functionality. Addons use Lua script, so it is heavily recommended you get a basic grasp of how lua works and are comfortable with it.
