# Welcome!

This is an upgraded version of the SCP:RP Addon Documentation.  
This documentation site was made to improve the experience of scripters within SCP:RP, allowing for a better understanding of the API.
Please note however, this is a passion project and we can't guarantee it will always be up-to-date.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us from the [discord server](https://discord.gg/cjHvAwGQY5)!  
You can find the documentation pages on the left.
