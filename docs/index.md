This is an upgraded version of the SCP:RP Addon Documentation.  
This documentation site was made to improve the experience of scripters within SCP:RP, allowing for a better understanding of the API.
Please note however, this is a passion project and we can't guarantee it will always be up-to-date.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us from the [discord server](https://discord.gg/cjHvAwGQY5)!  
You can find the documentation pages on the left.

!!! danger "AI Usage"
    It is heavily recommended that you do not use AI to script for you.  
    AI steals *real programmers' works* for its generation and often has overall poor practices.  
    Additionally, you may encounter errors as AI are poor at coding in such environments.  
    It is much better practice to look for real programmer's works or do it yourself, support some coders!
